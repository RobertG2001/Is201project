                        <p> My name is Isaac R. Gensel. I come from the Central Coast of California, a beautiful city called Monterey. I was born to Gordon and Robin Gensel in 2001 in Monterey and was raised there for the first 22 years of my life. I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and served a full-time mission in the Nairobi, Kenya mission from September 2022-September 2024. </p>
                        <p> I graduated from Monterey Highschool in 2019 and attended Hartnell Community College in the neighboring city of Salinas. During my time there I competed in intercollegiate Cross Country and Track and Field. Making history as the first Hartnell mens team to finish top three in the CCCAA state championships for Cross Country. I also was the individual Northern California men's 5,000m and 10,000m champion on the track. </p>
                        <p> Through my time in highschool and college I was lucky to work several different jobs and serve many unique people. Some of these included being a summer-camp counselor for the City of Monterey Recreation and an expert outfitter at the run-specialty store Fleet Feet Monterey. I also spent a few months learning how a manufacturing business works at Lula's Chocolate, a local chocolate factory. These jobs, and many others, allowed me to grow into a well-rounded individual who knows how to work hard and lead others. </p>
                        <p> The great opportunity to serve a mission in Kenya allowed me to not only grow as a leader, but also learn to serve. I worked nine hour days, six days a week helping people and teaching lessons about Jesus Christ. It was a challenging experience that taught me how to perservere and eventually thrive in a completely foreign environment. I love the people and the language. I am grateful for the extensive personal growth and leadership opportunities I had.</p>
                        <p> I am a transfer student at Brigham Young University now, applying to the Human-Resource Management major in June. I work at Trove Brands as a part-time customer service associate, taking phone calls, answering emails and regulating our AI Assistant. I look forward to more opportunities for growth as I continue my education and seek to bring myself and those around me closer to Jesus Christ.</p>
